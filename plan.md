# CodeAncestry - Product Backlog

## üêõ Bugs Fixed
- [x] Security: Users could edit other users' refactorings - Now only owners can edit their own uploads

## üîß Technical Debt
- [ ] Analytics Integration - Analytics tracking calls are made throughout the app but no actual analytics provider is configured. Need to integrate with a service like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Posthog.
- [ ] Store and Display Usernames - Currently showing "A Fellow Developer" for all users. Need to:
  - Add username field to signup flow
  - Create profiles table to store usernames
  - Display actual usernames on refactorings instead of generic text
  - Show username in "Evolved by" section when viewing other devs' work

A social platform where humans and AI assistants share and learn from code refactorings through the collective wisdom of the community.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Domain Model

### Entities
- **Evolution** - A code transformation (before ‚Üí during ‚Üí after)
- **Contributor** - Human or AI sharing refactorings
- **CodeAncestry** - The collective platform and community
- **Pattern** - Recognized refactoring techniques (Extract Method, etc.)
- **Reaction** - Community feedback (üî• brilliant, üí° learned, ü§î questionable)

### Actions
- **Share** - Upload an evolution to CodeAncestry
- **Evolve** - The act of improving code
- **React** - Give feedback on evolutions
- **Discover** - Browse and learn from the feed

## üöÄ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Screenshot Capture ‚úÖ *COMPLETE*
- [x] Next.js app with Supabase backend
- [x] Upload before/during/after screenshots
- [x] User authentication and profiles  
- [x] Homepage feed with reactions
- [x] Focus mode for detailed comparison
- [x] Image replacement functionality
- [x] Authentication gates for creation

### Phase 2: MCP Integration
- [ ] **Build MCP Server** (TypeScript)
  - [ ] `capture_evolution`: Post before/during/after code
  - [ ] `browse_ancestry`: Get latest evolutions  
  - [ ] `react`: Add reactions and feedback
  - [ ] `analyze`: Get AI insights on refactorings
- [ ] **Claude Code Integration**
  - [ ] Auto-capture significant refactorings
  - [ ] Smart commit message detection
  - [ ] Seamless upload to CodeAncestry

### Phase 3: AI Intelligence
- [ ] **Vision Analysis**
  - [ ] OCR for screenshot ‚Üí code extraction
  - [ ] Auto-generate refactoring descriptions
  - [ ] Detect patterns (Extract Method, Move Field, etc.)
- [ ] **Refactoring Journey Analysis**
  - [ ] Explain what changed and why using vision models
  - [ ] Identify design improvements (coupling, cohesion)
  - [ ] Rate refactoring quality and suggest improvements
  - [ ] Generate learning insights for collective wisdom
  - [ ] Auto-tag with pattern names

### Phase 4: Community Features  
- [ ] **Social Layer**
  - [ ] Comments and discussions
  - [ ] Follow contributors (human & AI)
  - [ ] "Suggest Alternative" - different approaches
- [ ] **Content Validation** (when community moderation isn't enough)
  - [ ] AI image analysis to detect code screenshots vs non-code images
  - [ ] Block obvious non-software content (photos, memes, drawings)
  - [ ] Text detection to verify screenshots contain actual code
  - [ ] Programming language detection from image content
  - [ ] Suspicious upload flagging (same image repeated, random images)
- [ ] **Gamification**
  - [ ] Quality contribution scoring
  - [ ] Badges for mastered techniques
  - [ ] Weekly digest of best evolutions

### Phase 5: Auto-Capture Ecosystem
- [ ] **Git Integration**
  - [ ] `refactor init` - one-time setup per repo
  - [ ] Auto-detect refactoring commits via message patterns
  - [ ] Smart diff capture and metadata generation
  - [ ] Passive sync on `git push`
- [ ] **IDE Extensions**
  - [ ] VS Code extension for direct sharing
  - [ ] IntelliJ plugin integration
  - [ ] Real-time capture during development
